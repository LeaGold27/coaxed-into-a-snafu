			<p>
			So you clicked on this email, expecting to be redirected to the password change page.
			Unfortunately, we are not Andrew Hall. The <em>real</em> password change is elsewhere in your inbox,
			forwarded from the <em>real</em> Andrew Hall. <strong>We were granted special permission to do this. Mr. Hall and the rest of administration are aware.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			What you have fallen victim to is known as <strong>phishing</strong>.
			</p>

			<h2>What is phishing?</h2>
			<p>Phishing is a social engineering tactic in which attackers send a fake email from some authority --- in this case, Mr. Hall --- containing some kind of malicious content.
			In our case, we sent a fake version of the self-service password change page. Don't worry! We didn't actually store your password, but a real attacker could have!
			Other phishing attacks can include malicious software, such as an "update program" that really just puts a virus on your computer.</p>
			<h2>What can you do to prevent it?</h2>
			<p>There are a number of ways to protect yourself from phishing, such as spam filters, but the most important thing is to look at the email itself. Let's take the one we
			sent as an example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>The from line</strong>: This email was sent not from andrew.hall@cherokeek12.net, but from andrew.hall.cherokeek12@gmail.com. Outlook provided a notification
				at the top to warn you that the email was sent from outside the organization. If you see that yellow box, be skeptical and double check the from line.</li>
				<li><strong>Writing style</strong>: We aren't sure how well we mimicked Mr. Hall's writing style, but you might be. If the email doesn't feel right somehow, there may
				be good reason for that.</li>
				<li><strong>Suspicious links</strong>: Generally, you don't want to click on links in emails. If there is a link in an email and you aren't sure, contact the person
				who the sender claims to be. You may be surprised by what they say, such as: "I didn't send that." Additionally, you can check where the link sends to.</li>
				<li><strong>URL</strong>: The bar at the top of your browser contains the URL of the page you're on. If it looks like something strange, such as "leagold27.io,"
				you may want to think twice about putting any sensitive information on that webpage.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>What to do if you suspect an email is fraudulent</h2>
			<p>The proper thing to do here would be to report it to the person being impersonated, in this case Mr. Hall. Again, he already knows that we're doing this, so you needn't do
			that in this case. Also, you should consider reporting the attempt to the FTC at <a href="https://reportfraud.ftc.gov">reportfraud.ftc.gov</a>.</p>
